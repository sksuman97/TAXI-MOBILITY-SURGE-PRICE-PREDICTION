# Taxi-Mobility-Surge-Price-Prediction
Data provided by an Indian cab aggregator service Sigma Cabs. Their customers can download their app on smartphones and book a cab from anywhere in the cities they operate in. They, in turn, search for cabs from various service providers and provide the best option to their clients across available options. They have been in operation for a little less than a year now. During this period, they have captured surge pricing types from the service providers.

In Taxi Mobility Surge Price Prediction our main objective is to build a predictive model, which could help in predicting the surge pricing type proactively.
